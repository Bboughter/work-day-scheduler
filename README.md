# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This project was made so a user can have an active work day scheduler where their events would stay on the page even when refreshed.
There is a built in clock, as well as one displayed, that changes the colors of the blocks to indicate past, present, and future hour blocks. The program was made by manipulating given HTML and CSS by using third party API's such as Dayjs and JQuery.

## Usage

The work day scheduler is actively deployed at https://bboughter.github.io/work-day-scheduler/.

To use this scheduler, click inside an hour block and type whatever information you would like to save for that time. The gray color indicates in the past, red in the present, and green in the future. You can refresh or leave the page and the information will still remain for you to view.
    

## Credits

HTML and CSS were previously provided. Minor changes to HTML with the classes were made in order to achieve the final result. Problem solving sessions took place with other UCLA Extension Full Stack Boot Camp students.
